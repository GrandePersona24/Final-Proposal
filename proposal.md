# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Checkers with power ups

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Simple checkers game with some powerups

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will be a playable checkers game against the computer. Alongside that I want to give the player an option to add power ups such as if you jump 2 pieces you instantly become a king piece. I would also like to add options for the player such as adjusting the board size or starting with a king piece.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would at least to make the checkers game and add at least one power up or option the user can use.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be the game and at least one power up and one option 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be multiple options and powerups without bugs.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First I'd have to find out what language would be best suited to make the game which from my understanding is unity. From there I'd have to learn the basics of unity such as how to use images and the like. From there I'd have to brainstorm what power ups and such I'd want to add and then see how to implement those.
